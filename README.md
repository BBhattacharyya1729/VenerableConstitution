# The official Ruddock House Constitution.

[![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution)

Whenever the constitution.tex file is changed, Travis CI will automatically compile the LaTeX to PDF and upload it [here](https://github.com/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution/releases/latest).

Any time an amendment is made to the constitution, someone with access to `that` must **manually** upload the PDF to `/home/ruddweb/RuddockWebsite/ruddock/static/constitution`.

If you have any questions about this repository, please contact a Ruddock IMSS Representative.

# The official Ruddock House Constitution.

## [View the PDF](https://github.com/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution/releases/latest) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution)

Whenever the constitution.tex file is changed, Travis CI will automatically compile the PDF (takes about two minutes) and deploy it to GitHub Releases. [View the current Travis build here.](https://travis-ci.org/RuddockHouse/RuddockConstitution)

**IMPORTANT**: Any time an amendment is made to the constitution, someone with access to `that` must **manually** upload the PDF to `/home/ruddweb/RuddockWebsite/ruddock/static/constitution`.

If you have any questions about this repository, please contact a Ruddock IMSS Representative.

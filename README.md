# The official Venerable House Constitution.

## [View the PDF](https://github.com/VenerableHouse/VenerableConstitution/releases/latest) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [![Travis](https://img.shields.io/travis/VenerableHouse/VenerableConstitution.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/VenerableHouse/VenerableConstitution)

Whenever the constitution.tex file is changed, Travis CI will automatically compile the PDF (takes about two minutes) and deploy it to GitHub Releases. It will also commit the file to [the `ruddock/static/constitution/` folder of the VenerableWebsite repo](https://github.com/VenerableHouse/VenerableWebsite/tree/master/ruddock/static/constitution).

[View the current Travis build here.](https://travis-ci.org/VenerableHouse/VenerableConstitution)

**IMPORTANT**: Any time any change is made to the constitution, someone with SSH access to `that` will have to log in and git pull the VenerableWebsite repo on the server, once Travis has finished the build.

If you have any questions about this repository, please contact a Venerable IMSS Representative.
